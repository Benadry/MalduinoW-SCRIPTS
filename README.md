Collection of my Malduino scripts

Payload-DWN.txt - This Script downloads a payload and runs it automaticly, You need to change Example.com/payload.exe to your source and Payload.exe to the name of your Payload

-
Hybrid-RealTime-Payload.txt - This is a mix of both scripts, Most types of virus or RAT files  will get detected by windows Real time protection, this can by bypassed by the first script with a delay to the payload right after
